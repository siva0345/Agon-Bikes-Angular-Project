        <p><b>Engine:</b>The "F" in the name suggests it could be a "fuel-injected" variant, indicating modern fuel
            delivery technology. The "250" implies a 250cc engine displacement, placing it in the middleweight category,
            suitable for both city commuting and occasional highway rides.</p>

            might produce around 24.1 horsepower, providing sufficient acceleration for urban riding and occasional
            highway cruising.
        </p>
        <p><b>Design:</b>Bajaj Pulsar motorcycles typically feature aggressive styling with sharp lines and dynamic
            graphics. The F250 might follow this design language with a sporty fairing, muscular fuel tank, and a sleek
            tail section.</p>

        <p><b>Features:</b>Being a part of the Pulsar series, it would likely come equipped with modern features such as
            LED lighting, digital instrumentation (including a digital speedometer, odometer, fuel gauge, and trip
            meters), and possibly even connectivity features like Bluetooth connectivity for smartphone integration.</p>

        <p><b>Suspension and Brakes:</b> Expect telescopic forks upfront and a monoshock suspension at the rear for a
            comfortable ride. Disc brakes on both ends with ABS (Anti-lock Braking System) would ensure reliable
            stopping power.</p>

        <p><b>Price:</b>The Ex-Showroom price of bajaj pulsar F250 is 1,50,451. Bajaj Pulsar bikes are known for their
            affordability, so the F250 would likely be competitively priced within its segment, making it accessible to
            a wide range of riders.</p>

        <p>Overall, the Bajaj Pulsar F250 offers a blend of performance, comfort, and features, making it a compelling
            option for riders looking for a versatile motorcycle for daily commuting as well as long-distance touring.
